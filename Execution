3)what is JDK,JRE,JVM?

1) interpreter?
      Java interpreter is a computer program (system software) that implements the JVM. 
      It is responsible for reading and executing the program. 
      It is designed in such a way that it can read the source program and translate the source code instruction by instruction.
2) JIT Compiler?
        The JIT or Just-In-Time compiler is an essential part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), that is responsible for performance optimization of java based applications during run time. 
         The compiler is one of the key aspects in deciding the performance of an application for both parties i.e.
          the end-user and the application developer. 
          Let us check the Just In Time Compiler in Java in more detail.
3) JDK ,JRE,JVM?
JDK:- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets.
It is a core package used in Java, along with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). 

JRE:- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is an open-access software distribution that has a Java class library, specific tools, and a separate JVM. In Java, JRE is one of the interrelated components in the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
      It is the most common environment available on devices for running Java programs. 
      Java source code is compiled and converted to Java bytecode. If you want to run this bytecode on any platform, you need JRE.
      The JRE loads classes check memory access and get system resources. JRE acts as a software layer on top of the operating system.

JVM:- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
