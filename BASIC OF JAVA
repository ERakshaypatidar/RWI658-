1. What is Java?
 - Java is a platform independent 
   multi-paradigm programming language.

   Note: Multi-Paradigm means it supports 
   multiple styles of programming 

   	Java supports 
	  1. Object-Oriented programming [From beginning version 1.0]
	  2. Functional programming      [From Java 8v]
	  3. Modular programming	 [From Java 9v]
	  4. Data-Oriented programming	 [From Java 17v]
	  5. Procedural programming      [From Java 22v] 
	  
	- In future versions it may also support 
	  scripting style programing 

   - For proof visit the website 
	  openjdk.org -> scroll down -> click on 21 -> click on 445 link
	  -> scroll down you can find a statement "Java is multi-paradigm language"
2. Who invented Java?
   - Java is invented by Mr. James Gosling
     in SUN Microsystems in the year 1991.

   - It is released in the year 1995. The version is
     released only for testing purpose.

   - The first version for project development is 
     released in the year 1996 as Java 1.0.

   - The latest version of Java is 22 
     it is released on Mar 19th 2024.

   - Currently Java is with Oracle Corporation
     In the year 2010 (the version number Java 7)
     Oracle Corporation acquired Java and all other 
     products of SUN Microsystems.
3. Why Java is invented?
   - Java is invented to achieve platform independency
     for developing internet based business applications
4. Types of applications?
     - In the computer world all softwares or project or applications
       are basically divided into two types
          1. Stand-alone applications
	  2. Internet applications

      - Stand-alone application
         - An application that is installed in one system
	   and if it is accessible only within this system
	   with a local call, and can not be accessibile from
	   other systems with a network via internet
	   then we call it as stand-alone application.

         - A stand-alone application is a single user 
	   and single computer application.

	 - For example:
	 	Calc, Notepad, Antivirus, MS-Office, game softwares,
                browser, mobile apps, ...

       - Internet application
         - An application that is installed in one system
	   and if it is accessible from other systems 
	   with a network via internet is called as 
	   internet application.

         - An internet application is a multi user 
	   and multi computer application.

	 - For example:
	 	youtube, instagram, facebook, amazon, zoom software, etc...

	
	Conclusion:
	  -> Any software you install in your system and use it,
	     it is a stand-alone application

	  -> Any software you access it via browser and use it
	     without installing in your system, then it is 
	     internet application
